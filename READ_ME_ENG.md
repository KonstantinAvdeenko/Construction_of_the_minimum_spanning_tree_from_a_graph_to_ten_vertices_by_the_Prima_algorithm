This program is in the C# programming language,
produces the construction of the minimum spanning tree by the Robert Prim algorithm using the method of mathematical matrices.
Building a minimum spanning tree is possible for any undirected graphs,
the number of vertices will be no more than ten.
This program is implemented to see the weight of the edges and their location,
see separately the sequence of edges from which the minimum spanning tree is formed.
The main module PostroenieMinOstovnogoDereva contains a single main function:
main - fully performing the above task.
